name: Sensor request
about: Suggest a new sensor to be added
---

**What is the purpose of this sensor?**
Describe why you would like to have this sensor.

**Is it supported on both iOS and Android?**
Please list the native APIs and additional resources you have found here.
If there is no native implementation for one of the two platforms this is most likely not going to make it into react-native-sensors. One of our main principles is that we want to have feature parity for iOS and Android, even if that leads to sensors not being added. If you feel like your sensor would be super valuable anyways, feel free to still open the issue so we can discuss the options.

**Is there a way to test this sensor without a real device?**
Yes / No / Unsure

**Would you be willing to respond to issues / PRs for this sensor?**
Yes / No / Unsure
