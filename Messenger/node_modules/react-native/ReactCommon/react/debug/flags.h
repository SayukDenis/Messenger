// Preprocessor flags which control whether code meant for debugging the
// internals of React Native is included in the build. E.g. debug assertions.
//
// This flag is normally derived from NDEBUG, but may be set explicitly by
// defining `REACT_NATIVE_DEBUG` or `REACT_NATIVE_PRODUCTION`.
#if !(defined(REACT_NATIVE_DEBUG) || defined(REACT_NATIVE_PRODUCTION))
#ifdef NDEBUG
#define REACT_NATIVE_PRODUCTION
#else
#define REACT_NATIVE_DEBUG
#endif
=======
// Enable REACT_NATIVE_DEBUG if NDEBUG is not defined.
// Due to BUCK defaults in open-source, NDEBUG is always defined for all android
// builds.
// If you build in OSS with CMake, you will have -DNDEBUG set only for release
// builds, therefore REACT_NATIVE_DEBUG will not be set. Here we introduce
// REACT_NATIVE_DEBUG that we use internally instead of NDEBUG that we can
// control and use as a more reliable xplat flag. For any build that doesn't
// have NDEBUG defined, we enable REACT_NATIVE_DEBUG for convenience.
